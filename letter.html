        <h1>My Himani, My Bubuuuu, 💗</h1>
        <p>
            Happy Anniversary, my Baby, my Himani
            Words will never be enough to capture everything you mean to me, but I’ll give it my all. You are the one I want beside me for the rest of forever. Every moment we’ve shared—every laugh, every tear, every late-night talk, every hug, and every kiss—it’s all been worth it because it’s us.
                
            We’ve had our share of ups and downs, but even in the hardest moments, it’s always been you. You’re the one I run to, the one I dream of, and the one I want to end every day with. Your voice is the sound I want to hear when I’m low, your face is the one I want to see when I talk about my day, and your arms are the place where I feel like I belong. Himani, your smile lights up my world, your touch makes me feel safe, and your presence makes everything feel right.

            You’ve shown me a love so pure, so patient, so kind—it’s a love I didn’t even know was possible until I met you. I can’t promise that life will always be perfect, but I can promise you. I promise to love you with all my heart, to stand by you no matter what, to listen when you need to talk, and to give you the space you deserve when you ask for it. I promise to always be your biggest cheerleader, your safest place, your partner in crime, your dreamer, and your family.  

            Baby, I just want to make you the happiest you’ve ever been. I want to be the one who makes you feel safe, loved, and comforted every single day. When things get tough and your eyes fill with tears, I’ll be here—always. I’ll hold you close until the weight feels a little lighter, until you feel just a little more okay. You’ll never have to face anything alone because I’m here for you. Always. I love you at your best, your worst, and every version of you in between.  

            Nothing will ever change that. What we have isn’t just any love story—it’s our love story, and it’s rare, it’s real, and it’s extraordinary. Himani, you’re not just my world—you’re my everything. You’re my home, my safe place, the love of my life. I’m not going anywhere; I’m here, and I’ll always be here, because there’s no one else I’d rather be with.  

            When I say I’d do anything for you, I mean it—absolutely anything. I love you now, and I’ll love you always, with everything I have in me. Whatever life throws at us, we’ll get through it together, because no matter what, I’ll keep choosing you every single day. Forever

            Himani, you’ve been my strength, my peace, my laughter, and my hope. I adore everything about you—the way you appreciate the smallest gestures, the way your hugs make me feel like I’m exactly where I’m meant to be, the way your voice calms my soul, and the way your smile makes me forget the world. You’ve taught me what it means to truly love, to care, to grow, and to cherish every moment we have together. 

            I’ll always hold onto the little things, like our late-night talks, the moments at our safe place, your hugs on the bike, and even the way you get grumpy with me—it all means so much because it’s you. You make every moment special, and every day with you feels like the best day of my life.  

            Himani, thank you for being you. For standing by me, for loving me, and for making me feel like the luckiest person alive. I love you with everything I have. Here’s to us, to everything we’ve been through, and to everything we’ll share in the years to come.  

            I love you, my Baby. Forever and always.  

            Yours,  
            Ruru 🍑💗
