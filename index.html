        <h1>Happy Anniversary, My Bubuuu ! ❤️</h1>
        My Baby, My Himani,*  

        I hope I can make you feel as valued and loved as you truly deserve because you are everything to me. You’re the best partner anyone could ever dream of. The most beautiful girl in the world—inside and out—and I hope you believe me because I mean it with all my heart. I can’t wait to marry you one day, to build a life together, and make cute little people with you. You are perfect for me in every way, my love, and my intentions with you are clear and genuine.  
        
        I want us to build a life hand-in-hand, get married, and start a family. I’m serious about us. I love you for exactly who you are, and I want to spend the rest of my life making sure you feel loved, cherished, and adored every single day.  
        
        You’re someone who always puts me before yourself, someone whose happiness lights up my world. You’ll be over the moon if I just bring you a single flower—and that’s what I adore about you. Your smile, your eyes, your silliness—they tell the most beautiful story, and your maturity makes my heart flutter. You’re the one I can’t imagine my life without, the one I need for the rest of forever. You bring out the best in me, inspire me to do better, and make me believe that everything is possible. God, Baby, I never want to lose you. I’ll love you forever.  
        
        Every time I laugh, it’s you I’m thinking of. Every time I see something beautiful, it’s you that comes to mind. Every time I sit by the window imagining what my life will look like in the years to come, I see you. Not a single moment goes by when you’re not in my thoughts, and I wouldn’t want it any other way.  
        
        You’re my Baby, my safe place, my forever. I love you, Himani. Always and with everything I have.
        <p>there’s more for you !</p>
